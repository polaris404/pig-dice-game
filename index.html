        <h1>Game Rules:</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On a turn, a player rolls the die ðŸŽ² repeatedly. The goal is to
            accumulate as many points as possible, adding up (hold) the numbers
            rolled on the die ðŸŽ².
          </li>
          <li>
            However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any
            points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns,
            just the total earned during that particular roll.
          </li>
          <li>
            A player has to choose to hold (stop rolling the die ðŸŽ²) if they do
            not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their
            points from this turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that
            turn are added to his or her score. When a player reaches certain
            points(Default is 100), the game ends and that player is the winner.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can change the score limit by submitting the new input value.
          </li>
